## Introduction
This is a general protocol for expression recombinant proteins from E. Coli. It is important that e. coli are kept under selective pressure; otherwise they will eject the plasmid and there will be no expression.  

## Materials  
- *Chemically competent BL21(DE3) e. coli*   
These cells are deficient in several proteases to increase protein yield.  
They also contain the T7 RNA polymerase gene under control of the lacUV5 promoter, allowing for inducible expression of your protein upon addition of IPTG.  
- *Expression plasmid*  
Must contain your protein of interest under control of the T7 promoter.  
Must contain the LacI (lac repressor) gene.  

## Protocol
### Day 1
Transform your expression plasmid into BL21(DE3) chemically competent cells according to standard protocols and plate under selective conditions.  
### Day 2  
- Autoclave 2-4 4L baffled culture flasks, containing 1L liquid LB each. Allow these flasks to cool to room temp overnight.  
- In the evening, innoculate a 50mL starter culture. Select one colony from your transformation from the previous day, and add it to 50mL LB-antibiotic in a 125mL baffled shaker flask (the volume of starter can be adjusted depending on number of 4L flasks). Shake overnight at 37C.  
### Day 3  
- Add appropriate antibiotic to the 4L flasks of LB.  
- Add 10-20mL of the starter culture to each 4L flask (volume will depend on the number of flasks). Accurate measurement will ensure all flasks are synchronized for induction.  
- Shake until bacteria reach OD-600 of 0.6-0.8, this typically takes 1-3 hours (OD-600: optical density, absorbance measured at 600nm. Can be measured in the Parker lab UV-Vis or the Cech lab NanoDrop)  
- Once the appropriate OD-600 has been reached, induce protein expression by adding IPTG (final concentration of 0.5mM, stock 1M solution stored at -20C)  
- Take a sample for SDS-PAGE  
- Decrease temperature to 18C and shake overnight (alternatively induction can be done at 37C for ~3hr. Optimal expression time and temperature will vary, and can be tested in small-scale expressions analyzed by SDS-PAGE)  
- Take a sample for SDS-PAGE  
- After induction, collect cells by centrifugation (3000xg for 15 minutes). This pellet can be flash frozen and stored at -80 for several months.
