## Types of pulldown
This document will provide brief descriptions of RNA pulldown methods performed in the lab, and help select the ideal pulldown for your system.

- *In vitro* pulldown
- Aptamer-tagged pulldown
- Antisense purification ([ChIRP](https://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/product/Magna-ChIRP-RNA-Interactome-Kit-Isolation-and-characterization-of-non-coding-RNAchromatin-complexes,MM_NF-17-10494))

## *In Vitro* Pulldown
##### Adapted from Gabi

###Buffers
#### I typically make 1L stocks of the wash buffers (LS-WB, WB-300, and WB-150) **without** DTT.
####Add DTT to wash buffers (~50mL each) and make Blocking buffer the day of the experiment 

#####Low-salt wash buffer (LS-WB):    
20 mM Hepes pH 7.9  
100 mM KCl  
10 mM MgCl2   
0.01% NP40  
1 mM DTT  
H2O to volume

##### Wash buffer-300 (WB-300):  
20 mM Hepes pH 7.9  
300 mM KCl  
10 mM MgCl2 
0.01% NP40  
1 mM DTT  
H2O to volume

##### Wash buffer-150 (WB-150):  
20 mM Hepes pH 7.9  
150 mM KCl  
10 mM MgCl2 
0.01% NP40  
1 mM DTT  
H2O to volume

#####Blocking Buffer:  
1 mg/ml BSA 
200 μg/ml Glycogen  
200 μg/ml tRNA  
fill up with WB-150

### Protocol
#### Blocking of beads
- Prepare 75 μl bead slurry per pulldown, plus 100 μl slurry for pre-clearing of protein extracts
- wash beads 2x with 500 μl LS-WB (collect by magnet between washes)
- add 1mL blocking buffer per tube 
- incubate at 4°C (cold room, mutating platform) for 2.5 h 
- wash beads 3x with 1mL WB-300 (mutator, 4°C, 5 min) 
- wash beads 1x with 1mL of WB-150 

#### Preclearing of Protein extracts
- incubate 100 μl blocked beads for pre-clearing with up to 10 ml protein extract → 3 h at 4°C, mutating platform 
- Collect beads on the magnet, and transfer supernatant into a fresh tube 
- Prepare protein input samples: 40 μl of protein + 40 μl of 2x SD. Heat at 95°C for 5 min and store at -20°C 

#### Preparation of protein extracts for pulldown
- add 100 U/ml RiboLock [40 U/μl stock]: 2.5 μl of stock per mL protein 
- add 0.1 mg/ml tRNA [10 mg/ml]: 10 μl of stock per ml protein 

#### Separate protein extract into the correct number of tubes (one per RNA)

#### Pulldown:
- Add 50 pmol biotinylated RNA to pre-cleared protein extract supplemented with tRNA and RiboLock
- incubate 1 h at 4°C 
- add 75 μl blocked beads to RNA-protein mix 
- incubate for 1.5 h at 4°C 
- Collect on magnet
- wash beads 5x with 1ml WB-150 (3x 5 min, 4°C on mutating platform + 2x short washes, vortex gently, then collect on magnet

#### At this point, bead treatment will depend on downstream analysis. 
- For SDS-PAGE or western blotting, resuspend beads in 40µL 6x protein loading buffer and boil (95C for 5 minutes) and load full sample, including beads, directly into gel.  
- For Mass Spec, wash beads an additional 10x in 1mL PBS (or any buffer **without detergent**)
